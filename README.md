# Grad_Orient
use SSE2 to calculate Gradient and Orientation

First,We use opencv add a image to program,image is organized with Row Major ,uchar type

Second,we Convert image to int16 type,calculate GradientX and GradientY

Then we calculate Gradient and Orientation with Convert GradientX and GradientY to float type
